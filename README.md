# My Personal Project

## Proposal

My project for CPSC210 is a personal **agenda application** designed to help keep students on track
with their courses and make personalized to-do lists. This application is intended for all UBC students
and especially those who need extra assistance in managing their time and meeting deadlines.
With the move to online learning, many courses use different platforms to deliver the course
contents. With this application, you will now be able to see your tasks for all your different courses in one spot.


*Features*:
- A courses timetable 
- A personalized todo list with due dates
- Individual course tabs with tasks specific to the course 


I wanted to create this project ever since starting first year at UBC online when I had to keep track
of all the different websites and modes of delivery that different courses preferred. Personally, keeping 
a paper agenda is not as effective as a digital one that can send reminders so that I don't accidentally miss
deadlines. Therefore, this motivated me to focus my 210 project on a school-oriented homework and course 
tracker application for the people of my school community.
