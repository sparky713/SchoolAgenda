# My Personal Project

## Proposal

More than just an agenda, **Do It Now UBC** is a personal assistant app that will remind and keep students on track
with their courses and personal tasks. **Do It Now UBC** is designed for all UBC students
and especially those who need extra assistance in managing their time and meeting deadlines.
With the move to online learning, many courses use different platforms to deliver the course
contents. **Do It Now UBC**, you can now access your courses from a single application.


*Features*:
- A courses timetable 
- A personalized todo list with due dates
- A Course page that contains upcoming tasks and links to the course's external websites
- A Calendar


I wanted to create this project ever since starting first year at UBC online when I had to keep track
of all the different websites and modes of delivery that different courses preferred. Personally, keeping 
a paper agenda is not as effective as a digital one that can send reminders and easier to accidently miss
deadlines. Therefore, this motivated me to focus my 210 project on a school-oriented homework and course 
tracker application for the people of my school community.
